        <p>

        <h1>Site Purpose</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to allow users to discover as the name implies,
            what the weather will be like at a given location and at a given time. The main goal
            of the website is to make it as <strong>simple to use as possible.</strong> That way, even inexperienced
            users
            can easily figure out where to go to find what they're looking for.
