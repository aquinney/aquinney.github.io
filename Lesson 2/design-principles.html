                Codecademy has large icons that are easy to read, and spaced the perfect distance apart from one another. This illistrates the law of Proximity.

                League of legends has a huge image to captivate you when you first log in. It's purpose is to tell you that their game is successful and ten years old. Therefore, it must be good. Below that is a button to get started playing. This is a nice Visual Heirarchy.

                Rently has a large, round, map button in the bottom corner so you can get a visual of where your selected home is located. This is a good example of Fitt's Law.
